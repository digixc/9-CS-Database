- A query is a question, often expressed in a formal way.
- A database query can be either a select query or an action query.
- A select query is a data retrieval query, while an action query asks for additional operations on the data, such as insertion, updating or deletion.

- Open your *Game Stock Database* from the last lesson.
- Today you are going to complete the following queries (Searches):
- Your Teacher will demonstrate how to create a query. 
  1. Create a query that finds *all games* that are *3+*.
  2. *All PlayStation games* in *alphabetical* order of *name*.
  3. An *RPG* game that is suitable for *11+*.
  4. *All Sport* games suitable for *3+*.

- In the previous lesson you should have used query guides to help you complete the five basic queries.
- Databases store data in a structured format, which can be accessed using queries.
- In fact, the structured query language (SQL) was designed specifically for this purpose.
- Users can create SQL queries that retrieve specific information from a database.

** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END: 
- Today your taks is to create a new query that uses at least 4 different criteria to search and display the results.
- *For example: xbox games, Sports Genre, age 15+ and Price less than £40.00.*
  1. Explain how you used criteria to search the database for required information.
  2. Explain how you used the sort function to sort the data in your search.
  3. Take screenshots to prove you have completed each search.
  4. Click on the SQL view to show the SQL commands used in your query, take a screenshot of this.
