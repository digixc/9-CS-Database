In this lesson you will develop an understanding of the learning strand *Data and data representation* on your progress ladder, working towards blue/indigo level.
- You will demonstrate understanding of searching databases.
- You will build knowledge of multiple search methods.
- You will contribute to query and searching discussions.
- You will understand the structure and purpose of SQL statements.

- A query is a question, often expressed in a formal way.
- A database query can be either a select query or an action query.
- A select query is a data retrieval query, while an action query asks for additional operations on the data, such as insertion, updating or deletion.

- Open your *Game Stock Database*[[file:doc/Game Stock Database 2018.accdb][ Download this file]] from the last lesson.
- Today you are going to complete the following queries (Searches):
- Your Teacher will demonstrate how to create a query or you can watch the video above or view this [[file:doc/Creating a query using the wizard.pdf][guide]]? 
  1. Create a query that finds *all games* that are *3+*.
  2. *All PlayStation games* in *alphabetical* order of *name*.
  3. An *RPG* game that is suitable for *11+*.
  4. *All Sport* games suitable for *15*.
  5. Your own query *(Any titles/platforms/age/price etc.)*

- In the previous lesson you should have used query guides to help you complete the five basic queries.
- Databases store data in a structured format, which can be accessed using queries.
- In fact, the structured query language (SQL) was designed specifically for this purpose.
- Users can create SQL queries that retrieve specific information from a database.

- Today your task is to create a new query that uses at least 4 different criteria to search and display the results.
- *For example: X-Box games, Sports Genre, age 15+ and Price less than Â£40.00.*
  1. Explain how you used criteria to search the database for required information.
  2. Explain how you used the sort function to sort the data in your search.
  3. Take screenshots to prove you have completed each search.
  4. Click on the SQL view to show the SQL commands used in your query, take a screenshot of this.
