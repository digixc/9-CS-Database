In this lesson you will develop an understanding of the learning strand *Data and data representation* on your progress ladder, working towards blue/indigo level.
- *Investigate* what a database is and their basic features.
- *Recognise and Explain* the importance of Databases
- *Explain* in detail key database terminology
* Database Basics, Terms & Definitions

+ A *database* is an *organised* store of *data*. 
+ Databases organise data in *tables*
+ A *table* contains the Data specific to one type of Entity, such as a table for people, a table for products, or a table for orders
+ A *record* is a single *row* in a table
+ A *record* contains many *fields* about an entity, for example a record of person may have the following fields: *lastname, firstname, dateOfBirth, phoneNumber, gender*
+ A *field* is a single *piece of data* about an entity, such as lastname.
+ *field* is also called *column*

An example of a table contains two records of people:

| LastName | FirstName | Gender | Role    | email           |
|----------+-----------+--------+---------+-----------------|

- We have been recording data since before the time of the Romans. In fact some of the earliest Databases come this period in history.
- The Romans would record such data as wheat harvests and military camp itineraries so they knew how much equipment the soldiers had at a fort.
- We obtain the word *Record* from the Latin word *Recordari*, the *noun* was earliest used in law to denote the fact of *being written down as evidence*.
- A *Record* is therefore a *collection of facts relating to an object, person or event*.
- For hundreds of years these records were recorded on paper, hence the term *Paper Database*.
- Before Computer Science, records were written on pieces of paper, which we called files, and stored in filing cabinets.
- Paper Filing Cabinets could store less than *6,000 files*, or *6000 records* because each record needed to be separated from the others for privacy reasons. 
- A Computer Database of the same size would only be a few *Megabytes* and fit on to a USB stick, and be less harmful on the trees than all that paper.

#+Begin_SRC 
Challenge 1: 

Why do we store data within Databases? 
What would an on-line store such as Amazon store within a Database?
What if they wanted to retrieve one record from a Paper based Database? 
How would this compare to an Electronic Database? 
How would this Data be organised? 

Now Think, Pair, Share!

*Learning Strand: Data and Data Representation*
- Using the Key Terms listed above identify and explain in detail the key definitions for Databases (Database,Table, Record, Field). You can achieve this by using an example such as the one we have covered for Challenge 1, explaining what tables & fields would be needed and what data would be stored in the records.
- Achieve this by using a Text Editor of your choice & submit your evidence on the Bourne to Learn website. 
- Each *Term* will need to be fully explained in your *own words* within a short paragraph, using an example. Remember to use full sentences and connectives (..because, therefore). 
* How are Databases Used?

- So Data is stored within a Database. It is organised into rows called Records. Each column represents a Field, which has specific types of Data. This could be Text, Numbers, Dates 
- For Example
[[./img/Student-record.png]]

- However why and how are Databases used?
- The first question can be answered by thinking about Paper based Databases. Computer Code can be written to search through data to *Match* a piece of Data. We call this querying the Database, Query being another word used instead of the word question
- A Query is created within Database programs such as Microsoft Access by pressing a key buttons and typing in the *Criteria*, what we call the Search Term.
- For web-based applications and almost everything else Queries are created using *SQL* which stands for Structured Query Language. Don't worry about this now we will be covering both in later lessons.
- This is not the only use of Databases however new Information can be obtained from a Database. First, let's refresh "what is Data?" and "what is Information?"
- The words "data" and "information" are often used as if they are synonyms. Nevertheless, they have different meanings.
- *Data*: Raw material, from which you can draw conclusions, facts from which you can deduce new facts. 
- *Information*: knowledge, intelligence, a particular piece of data with a special meaning or function. Information is often the result of combining, comparing and performing calculations on data. 
- Let's look at the example below.

*Learning Strand: Data and Data Representation*
- *What Databases do you use in your daily life? Perhaps on your phone, perhaps on your personal computer or laptop?*
- *Research* 2 applications in real life where Databases are used and how. 
- Achieve this by using a Text Editor of your choice & submit your evidence on the Bourne to Learn website. 
- Each *application* will need to be fully explained in your *own words* within a paragraph. 
- Remember to use full sentences and connectives (..because, therefore).

- A Database is an organised store of data. A Database is made up of various Tables containing Data specific for a purpose. For instance a Car Hire Database contains Data specific for Hiring a Car. One Table will be used to store the customer details wishing to hire a car. Another Table will be used to store the Hire Car details such as Registration Number and fuel type.
- A Table is used to contain the Data specific to an Entity. For instance the Customers are an Entity, and so are the hire cars. 
- A Record is a single Row of the Database. A Record contains data specific to one instance. For example Fred Smith's name and address within a customer database is an instance and therefore would be stored within a Record.
- A Field is a single Column of a Database. A field contains values relating to one property of an entity. For example the surnames within customer database, containing all the surnames of all the customers. Fields have specific types of data, such as text, whole numbers or date and time.
