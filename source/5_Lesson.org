In this lesson you will develop an understanding of the learning strand *Data and data representation* on your progress ladder, working towards blue/indigo level. You will also develop an understanding of the learning strand *Information Technology* towards Violet level by undertaking a creative project by building a graphical user interface.
- The different user interfaces (Human Computer Interface HCI) and their advantages and disadvantages.
- The core components needed for a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- How to create a *GUI* for a Database

* Windows, Icons, Menus & Pointers

- The earliest computers relied on their operators typing in commands using a typewriter keyboard interface.
- There are advantages to such an interface, but there are many disadvantages. Try and think of a few?
- When IBM created SQL in 1974 they wanted the language to be robust because of what Databases contain, i.e. people's personal data.
- So IBM's view was to separate the two parts into the Front end, user interface and the Rear end that contains the Database Engine.
- The front end is independent so as the User Interfaces changes with time (modernisation) it will not impact on the Database itself.
- Consider the progress within computing that has happened since 1974 and how the latest interface (the World Wide Web) drives Databases today.

*Learning Strand: Data and Data Representation*
- Research the different Computer - Human Interfaces (min 3) analysing how each interfaces works and why it was created.
- You must detail the main advantages and disadvantages for each interface in terms of ease of use, complexity and the amount of computer processing needed.
- - Achieve this by using a Text Editor of your choice & submit your evidence on the Bourne to Learn website. 
- Each *Interface* will need to be fully explained in your *own words* within a short paragraph, using an example. Remember to use full sentences and connectives (..because, therefore).

- Open your *Game Stock Database*[[file:doc/Game Stock Database 2018.accdb][ Download this file]] from the last lesson.
- Today you are going to design and create a graphical user interface for the Database:
- Your Teacher will demonstrate how to create a basic GUI or you can watch the video above or view this [[file:doc/Creating a form using the wizard.pdf][guide]]? 
  1. Create a basic GUI for your Game Stock Database.
  2. Create a *Logo* in *GIMP* for your Company.
  3. Add your *Logo* to your GUI and other appropriate images including a colour scheme.
  4. Add *navigation buttons* to help the user navigate through the records.

*Learning Strand: Data and Data Representation*
- Upload your screenshots of the Database GUI you have created, including an explanation of how the user would use the interface used to www.bournetolearn.com.

:END:
*Learning Strand: Data and Data Representation*
- Research the range of features you can add to your GUI using Microsoft Access.
- Detail and explain these features in a 200 word short essay, explaining how they might work to a potential customer.

If your interested in GUI's and how they came about, watch this video concerning the history of Graphical User Interfaces.
